<!-- ### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.   -->

#### MVP 
<!-- *These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.* -->

- Find and use external api  
- Allow user to type in a spell or cantrip. Press button to search
- User recieves information regarding spell/cantrip
- Render the data on the page that can be read and interrepted easily. 
- Allow a reset button to search different spells
- Make it compartible on desktop and mobile.
- Commit daily

#### PostMVP  
<!-- *These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.* -->

- Add second API. Adding a classes option.
- Use local storage to save user favorites
- Create a button to "flip" the page. (Animation)
- Add more style to the page. 

## Project Schedule
<!-- 
This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`. -->

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|Dec 10-12| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Complete
|Dec 13| Project Approval | Incomplete
|Dec 13| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|Dec 14| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|Dec 15| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|Dec 16| MVP | Incomplete
|Dec 17| Presentations | Incomplete

## Priority Matrix
![](https://whimsical.com/priority-matrix-6kzFUAKyDBqQe9NXnvMpi3")
<!-- Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes -->

## Timeframes

<!-- Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly. -->
